## Overview

Welcome to the `Gpu-Abuser-Malware` repository! This project explores how GPUs can be misused for executing potentially malicious activities such as payload decryption, leveraging the computational power of GPUs to evade traditional CPU-based detection mechanisms.

The goal of this repository is to document my research and provide practical examples of GPU-based malware techniques for educational purposes. This repository will be updated as I explore and document new strategies.

## Techniques Included

This repository currently includes the following techniques:

- **GPU-Based Decryption**: Using the GPU to perform decryption operations for potentially malicious payloads.
  - `PayloadDecryption`: A sample demonstrating payload decryption using OpenCL.
  
- **Anti-Detection**: Techniques to bypass detection by offloading processing to the GPU.
  - `AntiDebuggingUsingGPU`: Methods to hinder debugging by utilizing the GPU for processing.

### Upcoming Techniques

This repository will continue to expand as I explore more. Future topics to be covered include:

- **GPU-Based Encryption**
- **Memory Manipulation Using GPU**
- **Covert Data Storage in GPU Memory**

Stay tuned for updates!
